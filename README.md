# PrivaSight

## Data Privacy, Meet Data Profitability

PrivaSight is a decentralized platform that empowers users to monetize their personal data while maintaining complete privacy. By combining blockchain technology, privacy-preserving computation, and a token economy, PrivaSight creates a secure ecosystem where data owners can earn rewards while researchers and analysts gain valuable insights‚Äîall without exposing raw data.

## üåü Core Features

### DataVault NFTs

- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Your data is encrypted before being stored on-chain using the Secret Network
- **Privacy-Enforcing Access Rules**: Set granular permissions for who can access your data and for what purpose
- **Provable Ownership**: Each vault is a unique NFT, giving you true ownership of your personal data
- **Access History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of who accessed your data and when

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify data properties without revealing the data itself
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Perform analytics across multiple data sources while keeping individual data private
- **Homomorphic Computation**: Process encrypted data without ever decrypting it
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Generate valuable insights from aggregated data

### PRIVA Token Economy

- **Earnings**: Get paid in PRIVA tokens when your data contributes to research
- **Staking**: Boost your data visibility and earning potential by staking tokens
- **Governance**: Vote on platform upgrades and policies
- **Marketplace**: Buy, sell, or rent data access rights in the PRIVA marketplace

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PrivaSight employs a five-layer architecture to ensure security, scalability, and usability:

### 1. User Interface Layer

Web and mobile applications for data owners, researchers, and governance participants.

### 2. Smart Contract Layer

Blockchain-based logic for NFTs, tokens, and the governance mechanism.

### 3. Privacy Layer

Zero-knowledge proofs and secure computation mechanisms that ensure data privacy.

### 4. Data Storage Layer

Decentralized storage for encrypted data using Secret Network, IPFS/Filecoin, and Ceramic.

### 5. Analytics Layer

AI systems for processing encrypted data and generating valuable insights.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Upload & Mint**: Users encrypt their personal data and mint a DataVault NFT that acts as a secure container.

2. **Set Access Rules**: Users define who can access their data and for what purposes (e.g., "medical research only").

3. **Researcher Requests**: Researchers request access to DataVaults matching their criteria and offer PRIVA tokens as compensation.

4. **Private Computation**: When approved, the Privacy Layer runs computations across the encrypted data using zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation.

5. **Results & Rewards**: Researchers receive valuable insights while data owners earn PRIVA tokens‚Äîall without exposing sensitive personal information.

## üìä Example Use Case: Healthcare Research

Alice has health records she wants to monetize without compromising her privacy:

1. Alice encrypts her health data and mints a DataVault NFT with the rule "diabetes research only"
2. Dr. Bob, a diabetes researcher, discovers Alice's DataVault (and many others) through the marketplace
3. Dr. Bob requests access and offers 50 PRIVA tokens as compensation
4. The Privacy Layer verifies that Dr. Bob's credentials meet Alice's access rules
5. When Alice approves, the system uses secure computation to analyze Alice's data alongside many others
6. Dr. Bob receives aggregated insights about glucose patterns without seeing Alice's individual data
7. Alice earns PRIVA tokens, and her raw data remains secure and private
